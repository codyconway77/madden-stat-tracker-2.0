## Purpose of project

I have always wanted a way to keep track of my win - loss record against friends in local games of the Madden video game. This website is my passion project to make that a reality. Implements a simple signup and login with only a username and password required. Index page with show a quick overview of recent games which you can click on to expand to view more detailed stats of that game. There is an input form to send game info (opponent, score, stats, etc...) to the database to persist.

## Work in progress features

- Team page which will include stats for each team
- Stats of all games vs specific opponents

## Ideas/ Wish list features

- Nice illustrations or graphs of stats
